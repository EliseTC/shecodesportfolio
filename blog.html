          <p class="card-text"><b>Give a man a mask…</b> <br/>“Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.”
            This quote by Oscar Wilde has kept me company during the past couple of weeks. Weeks I predominantly spent in bed, with broken bones and a wandering mind. The words fascinate me because they seem to ring true and untrue in equal measure.

          <p class="card-text"><b>A disjointed mermaid</b> <br/>I had a dream. A dream vivid as reality but filled with oddities that could not possibly be true.

            Dreams show a truth we can’t yet fully embrace. A truth that has been chained up in our subconscious, ready to slip out when given the chance. So when we dwell in the realm of the night we see fragments of what we do not yet consciously accept. We see a reality cloaked in surrealism and strangeness to make the message we dread to face dismissible as fiction perhaps.

          <p class="card-text"><b>Why I will dance again</b> <br/>My body and I have had a troublesome relationship for as long as I can remember. A disjointed love affair with many highs and lows.

            I have been able to travel around freely and have so far enjoyed a good health, but even so my bones and joints have hindered me on and off. By giving up unexpectedly. By dislocating brutally, turning careless joy into agony when least expected.

            It was the first time I grabbed all attention on the dancefloor. Not because I was suddenly the most charming or elegant ballerina. Not because I executed the routine of that night with the greatest finesse. But because it was the night I dislocated my knee so horribly that I broke my arm whilst attempting to minimise the damage.

          <p class="card-text"><b>Memories in the starlight</b> <br/>They shine bright in the darkness of a melancholic mind. They nourish a longing body and cradle a saddened soul. They torture an insecure heart and cause a broken spirit to crumble. They live on, long after they were initially fuelled. They dazzle, like the light of stars from years and years ago.

          <p class="card-text"><b>Life imitates art</b> <br/>A couple of years ago a friend and I sat down in a tranquil bar in La Paz. We had been running around town, taking in its splendour and imperfections. Tasting its high-altitude air and vibe. The sound of progressive rock and a random collection of Lana del Rey tunes welcomed us into the small vintage-looking venue.

          <p class="card-text"><b>The Liar</b> <br/>Poetry has never been my forte, but years ago during a persistent episode of demonic darkness I decided to take up my pen to release my mind. As the words started flowing, I found myself writing in rhyme.

          <p class="card-text"><b>Heroes and heretics</b> <br/>The notion that some people are classified as heroes and others as villains has always intrigued me. Growing up, fairy tales and histories with their respective protagonists captured my imagination. More recently I have been thinking a lot about heroism because both of my main characters in The Edge of the World have inherited that interest of mine.
