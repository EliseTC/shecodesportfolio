                    <p class="blogpostaccordion">I returned home after spending four days and three nights in the hospital. While I was technically able to move at this stage, it was excruciatingly painful to do so.</p>
                    <p class="blogpostaccordion">The first thing I regretted after I arrived home was not having pre-ordered the ice machine I had grown very attached to during my hospital stay. Whilst renting one was by no means cheap, it was worth the investment because it was literally the only thing that kept me going through the next couple of weeks.</p>
                    <p class="blogpostaccordion">My leg was insanely swollen and bruised from my mid-upper leg until the ankle. I had to wear a tight brace around the leg whilst moving. The pressure this put on the swelling and the fact that the pain would rush down my leg whenever I got up meant that it was almost impossible to move. This gradually got better at around the 2 week mark.</p>
                    <p class="blogpostaccordion">I was unable to do anything other than rest, eat, ice, elevate my leg and take medicine. I had hoped to binge watch the series I had saved up for weeks and to read the pile of books I had collected. My concentration levels were gone however, so I only managed to re-watch the Lord of the Rings, the films I love most dearly.</p>
                    <p class="blogpostaccordion">Throughout the day I would try to do the exercises the physio therapist in the hospital had given me.</p>
